# Wall-Fresh
<p>Wall-Fresh is a script that downloads images from different subreddits. I personally use it to download pictures from /r/earthporn to rotate through as my desktop background. I make sure to filter out pictures with resolution lower than 1920 x 1080 and pictures in portrait mode. This is written using the reddits PRAW API to parse and urlib, requests to download. In addition this script also implements the PIL library to check the resolution of the image before saving to the computer.
